### Hi there 👋
## I have completed my Bachelor's degree in Algorithmic Computer Science at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. Currently, I am applying for a Master's program in the same field. During my studies, I have completed several courses and projects, the list of which is available [here](https://github.com/Taborevia/Studies-projects).
